# Design
We embrace aestetics of extreme minimalism almost [brutalist](https://elementor.com/blog/brutalism-in-web-design/)
for several long term strategic reasons, among them

1) being aesthetically different, as far as possible from Material, Bootstrap and similar projects, makes it clear for managers in Public Administrations that we are not looking for visibility but only to have the Law respected and lives and rights of our people protected

2) kids and teen who approach our website will see something very different from what they see elsewhere, completely focused on contents and that do not try in any way to lure them or to retain them. And they will see that the project is successful and think "Hey, you might be successful even by being that **different**?"

3) we can't use the aestetics of our adversaries to oppose them without legitimizing their existance.

People come (and stay) on our website **for what we do** and **for the data and software we produce** and forcing them to browse a weirdly simple site (while accessible and very readable and easy to use) extends their [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window), move them out of their usual perspective and force them to see how empty are so many media channel the are cool and fashion (as defined by USA-corporate marketing).

# Coding Guidelines

Code like if your hack should be maintained by a child who
just learned how to code.

Do NOT try to solve problems that you haven't measured before.

Do NOT apply any "enterprise best practice". We are not a company.  
Do NOT try to show us how smart you are. We don't care.

Avoid dependencies.

Use good sense... but remember: it's not common.
