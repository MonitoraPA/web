# Coding Guidelines

Code like if your hack should be maintained by a child who
just learned how to code.

Do NOT try to solve problems that you haven't measured before.

Do NOT apply any "enterprise best practice". We are not a company.  
Do NOT try to show us how smart you are. We don't care.

Avoid dependencies.

Use good sense... but remember: it's not common.
